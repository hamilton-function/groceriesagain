# Doing groceries again: Towards a decision augmentation for grocery stores selection
## Daniyal Kazempour, Melanie Oelker, Peer Kr√∂ger

Code for a prototype that fuses information from different sources (Google Maps [Distances, Traffic], Google Popular Times, Google Timeline (own timeline data)) and provides a visualization to queries of the type "Get me all [stores of a company X] in my viccinity" based on distance, traffic time, and our own designed utility score.

In order to use the code there are the following modifications required: (1) Replace the placeholder with a Google Maps API key of your own, (2) Insert your starting point for your query, (3) provide a path to your own (downloaded) Google Timeline data.
